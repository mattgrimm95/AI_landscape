# Decisions Log

A high-level record of steps taken and decisions made while implementing the
`app_plan.md` flow. Newest entries at the bottom.

## 2026-05-21 — Initial implementation

### Step 1 — Environment review
- Python 3.9.5 available; network reachable; `beautifulsoup4` already installed.
- `feedparser` and `spacy` not installed — scheduled for install.

### Step 2 — Architecture decisions
- **Language: Python.** Best ecosystem for scraping + NER; already present.
- **Storage: two SQLite databases** (the "multiple databases" from the flow):
  - `data/raw_log.db` — the *database log*: scraped documents + raw NER output.
  - `data/knowledge_graph.db` — *knowledge graph*: nodes, edges, aliases.
  - SQLite chosen for **minimal-to-no-cost** hosting (file-based, no server)
    and low operational complexity.
- **Version-controllable / revertible:** `data/*.db` are gitignored (volatile),
  but a `snapshot` command exports both databases to JSON in `snapshots/`,
  which *is* committed. Restoring = re-importing a snapshot. This satisfies
  "version-controllable objects including the database to revert".
- **Non-destructive by default:** the raw log is append-only; documents are
  de-duplicated by content hash; graph writes are upserts (never deletes).
  The only destructive command (`reset`) requires an explicit `--confirm`
  flag — i.e. it must be clearly initiated by a human prompt.
- **NER: pluggable backends.** `spaCy` (`en_core_web_sm`) when available; a
  deterministic rule-based extractor as fallback. Keeps tests fast and the
  system runnable even before the heavy model is installed.

### Step 2b — Dependency pivot (no heavy deps)
- `pip` cannot reach PyPI from this machine — SSL certificate verification
  fails for `pypi.org`. `feedparser` and `spacy` could not be installed.
- **Decision:** build entirely on the **Python standard library +
  `beautifulsoup4`** (already installed). Rather than disable TLS verification
  to force the installs, the system is designed with no heavy dependencies:
  - Feeds parsed with stdlib `xml.etree.ElementTree` (RSS 2.0 + Atom).
  - HTTP fetched with stdlib `urllib.request`.
  - NER done by the rule-based extractor plus a curated national-security
    **gazetteer** (high-precision domain matching).
  This *improves* the system against the skills_plan paradigms — zero install
  friction, minimal cost, low computational complexity, faster MVP — so it is
  adopted as the primary design, not a fallback. The NER layer keeps a
  pluggable `spacy` backend that is used automatically if the package is ever
  installed.

### Step 3 — Flow / guideline adjustments
- **Modular monolith instead of literal microservices.** The plan lists a
  microservices paradigm; for the MVP the modules (`scraper`, `ner`,
  `storage`, `reconcile`, `pipeline`) are kept as separate, independently
  testable units inside one package. This reaches MVP faster and keeps cost
  near zero; the seams are clean enough to split into services later.
- **Scraping uses feed-provided summaries/content** (RSS/Atom) rather than
  fetching and parsing every full article page. This is more stable, far
  lighter, and keeps the focus on the databases + NER as requested.
  Full-article fetching is recorded as a future extension.
- **Relationships are co-occurrence edges** for the MVP: entities appearing in
  the same document are linked (`co_occurs_with`), with edge weight =
  co-occurrence count. Typed/semantic relations are a future extension.

### Step 4 — Implementation
- Package `ailandscape/`: `scraper`, `ner` (+ `gazetteer`), `storage_raw`,
  `storage_kg`, `reconcile`, `pipeline`, `cli`.
- CLI verbs: `run` (live feeds), `demo` (bundled `samples/sample_feed.xml`,
  no network), `stats`, `snapshot`, `reset --confirm`.
- 24 `unittest` tests in `tests/` (storage, scraper, NER, reconcile,
  end-to-end pipeline) — all passing.

### Step 5 — Verification and an NER-quality iteration
- First live run: 3 feeds, 82 articles → 82 documents, ~8.2k raw entities.
  The graph had ~2.9k nodes — clearly inflated, because the greedy
  rule-based NER turns every sentence-initial capitalized word into an
  entity.
- **Adjustment (NER precision):** the app_plan flow already separates "NER /
  data creation" (raw) from step 4 "filter / de-duplicate / reconcile". So
  the NER stage is kept deliberately greedy and faithful in the raw log, and
  a precision filter was added to `reconcile`: untyped single-word ("misc")
  entities are dropped unless several documents mention them (document
  frequency >= 2). Typed gazetteer hits, multi-word phrases, and
  human-curated merges are always kept. The gazetteer was also expanded
  (more countries, commands, and systems).
- Second live run after the adjustment: 82 documents, ~8.3k raw entities ->
  1,860 nodes, 26,368 co-occurrence edges. Top entities (United States,
  Iran, U.S. Navy/Air Force/Army, Trump, Israel, Ukraine, Pentagon) are all
  legitimate and correctly typed.
- `snapshot` verified: both databases export to a single JSON file under
  `snapshots/` and round-trip cleanly.

## 2026-05-21 — Source-of-truth refactor (reproducible databases)

### Why
- Question raised: would `data/*.db` really "regenerate the same"? It would
  not — `run` fetches whatever the live feeds currently hold, and feed
  contents roll over time. The graph was deterministic *given* the raw log,
  but the raw log itself was not reproducible, and it was gitignored — so
  losing it meant losing unrecoverable scraped history. The skills_plan
  "version-controllable / revertible" requirement was therefore not met.

### Change
- Added a **corpus**: `corpus/documents.jsonl`, an append-only, one-object-
  per-line file of scraped documents. It is **committed to git** and is the
  single source of truth.
- Both SQLite databases are now **derived caches**. `pipeline.rebuild`
  regenerates them from the corpus; `data/` stays gitignored.
- Determinism work so the same corpus always yields the same databases:
  - `fetched_at` and `content_hash` are captured once at scrape time and
    stored in the corpus (not regenerated on rebuild).
  - entity `extracted_at` is derived from the document's `fetched_at`, not
    the wall clock.
  - `clear()` resets SQLite autoincrement counters, so document/node/edge
    ids are reproducible across rebuilds.
- New CLI verb `rebuild` regenerates the databases from the corpus with no
  network. `run` = scrape-into-corpus + rebuild. `demo` now runs fully in a
  throwaway directory. `reset` deletes only the derived databases and leaves
  the corpus intact.

### Verification
- Live run: 81 documents into the corpus -> 1,786 nodes, 27,912 edges.
- Reproducibility proven: SHA-256 of the knowledge graph and of the raw log
  are byte-identical before and after a `rebuild` from the same corpus.
- Test suite expanded to 31 tests, including corpus round-trip and a
  rebuild-determinism check; all passing.

## 2026-05-21 — NER output log refactor

### Why
- After the corpus became the source of truth, `raw_log.db` was no longer a
  source of truth — just a derived cache. Its `documents` table was a near
  exact duplicate of the corpus, which is redundant.

### Change
- Renamed `raw_log.db` -> `ner_output_log.db` (module `storage_raw.py` ->
  `storage_ner.py`, class `RawLogStore` -> `NEROutputLog`).
- **Dropped the `documents` table.** The store now holds only the `entities`
  table — raw NER output keyed by the corpus document's `content_hash`.
- Dropped the `extracted_at` column (the corpus already records `fetched_at`).
- `reconcile` now takes the corpus document list plus the NER log and joins
  them on `content_hash`; `pipeline.rebuild` runs NER straight into the log.
- Net effect: one clear chain — corpus (source of truth) -> NER output log
  (entity cache) -> knowledge graph — with no duplicated document storage.

### Verification
- All 31 tests updated and passing.
- Behaviour preserved: `demo` still yields 18 nodes / 49 edges, and a
  `rebuild` from the existing 81-document corpus still yields 1,786 nodes /
  27,912 edges — identical to before the refactor.

## 2026-05-21 — Daily scrape automation

- Added `scripts/daily_scrape.ps1`: runs `ailandscape.cli run`, then commits
  and pushes the corpus when new articles were added. Paths are resolved
  relative to the script's own location (repo) and from `PATH` (python/git),
  so nothing environment-specific is hardcoded — the script leaks no username
  or machine layout and is safe to commit to the public repo.
- Registered a Windows Task Scheduler job ("AI_landscape Daily Scrape") that
  runs the script daily at 19:00 local time (7PM Eastern; the OS handles the
  EST/EDT switch). `StartWhenAvailable` lets a missed run catch up when the
  PC next wakes. The scheduled-task entry is machine-local config, not part
  of the repo.
- Chose Windows Task Scheduler over a cloud scheduled agent: the job is a
  fixed, deterministic command that needs no AI reasoning, so a local
  cron-style task is free, has no billing question, and is the right tool.

## 2026-05-21 — AI-focused feeds and corpus recreation

- Replaced the 3 general feeds with **12 AI-focused feeds**, each verified to
  return a parseable RSS/Atom feed. Split **8 national-defense : 4 public AI
  = 2:1** by feed count, as requested. The public set includes MIT News (AI
  topic feed) and the Stanford AI Lab blog.
- Added `scraper.MAX_ARTICLES_PER_FEED` (50): only the 50 most-recent entries
  of any feed are kept, so one large feed cannot dominate the corpus. This
  was necessary — OpenAI's feed alone returned 971 entries, which uncapped
  would have flooded the corpus and wrecked the intended defense focus.
- Recreated the corpus from scratch (deleted and rebuilt): 378 documents
  across the 12 feeds (213 defense / 165 public) -> 18,495 entities ->
  4,573 graph nodes, 72,167 edges.

## 2026-05-22 — Per-article extraction with trafilatura

### Why
- The scraper only parsed RSS/Atom feeds and took whatever they embedded —
  often just a teaser, and always carrying boilerplate (photo credits,
  "appeared first on …", author contact lines) that polluted NER.

### Change
- `pip` could not reach PyPI: its bundled `certifi` lacked CA roots present
  in the Windows trust store. Fixed by installing with `--cert` pointed at an
  exported Windows CA bundle — TLS verification stays fully on (no
  `--trusted-host` bypass). The bundle was a one-off and has been deleted.
- Added `trafilatura` (+ `lxml_html_clean`). The scraper now fetches each
  article's own page and extracts the main text with trafilatura, which
  strips navigation, ads, captions, and footers. The feed's embedded content
  is the fallback when a page cannot be fetched or extracted.
- De-duplication is now by URL+title (`content_hash` no longer includes body
  text), so a known article is skipped *before* its page is fetched.
- A 1s polite delay separates article-page fetches.
- Fixed a Windows crash: a `print` of a title containing characters outside
  cp1252 killed the run; the CLI now forces UTF-8 stdout/stderr.

### Result
- Recreated corpus: 378 documents; 278 of the 354 freshly scraped docs got
  clean trafilatura extraction (the rest fell back to feed content — blocked
  or empty pages). Median document length rose to ~4,500 characters.
  25,016 entities -> 5,628 nodes, 116,929 edges.

## 2026-05-22 — feedparser, and a spaCy NER measurement

### feedparser
- Replaced the hand-rolled `ElementTree` feed parsing with `feedparser`,
  removing ~40 lines (`_strip_namespaces`, `_text_of`, `_link_of`) and
  tolerating malformed feeds instead of crashing on them. `pip` itself was
  also upgraded (21.1.1 -> 26.0.1).

### spaCy — measured, not adopted as default
- The latest spaCy (3.8) dropped Python 3.9 support, so `spacy<3.8` (3.7.5)
  plus `en_core_web_sm` were installed.
- Rebuild measurement on the 378-document corpus:
  - rule:  ~5 s  -> 25,016 entities, 5,628 nodes, 116,929 edges
  - spaCy: ~58 s -> 21,394 entities, 6,601 nodes,  98,409 edges
- spaCy types every node (no "misc" bucket) and finds more distinct
  entities, but it returns raw surface forms — losing the gazetteer's
  canonicalization ("U.S." and "The United States" become separate nodes) —
  and the small model mislabels some organizations as people. Neither
  backend is a clear win; a gazetteer + spaCy hybrid would be.
- Decision: the rule backend stays the default. The default is now an
  explicit setting (`config.DEFAULT_NER_BACKEND`) rather than being inferred
  from whichever package is installed — installing spaCy must not silently
  change pipeline behaviour. spaCy is available on demand via `--ner spacy`.

## 2026-05-22 — Hybrid NER backend and stronger de-duplication

### Hybrid NER (new default)
- Added a "hybrid" NER backend: the gazetteer runs first (precise, canonical
  names for curated defense entities), and spaCy supplies typed entities for
  the rest of the text; where a spaCy span overlaps a gazetteer span the
  gazetteer wins. It degrades to the rule backend if spaCy is absent.
- Made "hybrid" the default. Rebuild: 6,000 nodes (rule 5,628 /
  pure-spaCy 6,601). Every node is typed — there is no "misc" bucket. The
  gazetteer's canonicalization fixes pure-spaCy's fragmentation: "United
  States" is now a single node (1,048 mentions) rather than separate
  "U.S." and "The United States" nodes.

### Stronger de-duplication
- `reconcile.normalize` now collapses more wording variants onto the same
  node key, so the variants merge and their relationship edges merge with
  them: possessive "'s", acronym dots ("U.S." == "US"), and a trailing
  plural on the final word ("drone swarms" == "drone swarm", "F-35s" ==
  "F-35").
- Default ignore terms are normalized before matching so they keep working
  under the new normalization.

## 2026-05-22 — Statistical overview report (first attempt)

- Added `report.py` and an `overview` CLI command: a readable statistical
  summary of the pipeline data — the funnel (articles -> raw mentions ->
  nodes -> edges), scrape recency / "scraped in the last 24h", scrape
  duration, entity- and relationship-type breakdowns, the most prominent and
  most-connected entities, and data-quality signals (single-mention nodes,
  possible partial-name duplicates).
- `pipeline.run` now records each run's timing and counts to
  `data/run_history.jsonl`; the overview reports the latest run.
- First-attempt findings on the 378-document corpus: 22,091 raw mentions
  collapse to 6,000 nodes, but ~69% of nodes are single-mention (long tail /
  noise) and ~277 look like partial-name duplicates — both point at
  entity-resolution as the next improvement (tracked in TODO).

## 2026-05-22 — Interactive knowledge-graph visualization

- Added `visualize.py` and a `visualize` CLI command: renders a
  self-contained interactive HTML graph with pyvis / vis.js — zoom, pan,
  drag; hover a node for its details; click a node to highlight its
  neighborhood and dim the rest; a dropdown finds any entity.
- The full graph (6,000 nodes / 95k edges) is an unreadable hairball, so a
  comprehensible subgraph is selected first: by default the ~70
  most-connected entities; `--focus "<entity>"` centers on one entity and
  its neighborhood instead. Filters: `--type`, `--min-mentions`,
  `--max-nodes`, `--min-weight`. Nodes are sized by mention count and
  coloured by entity type.
- Added a `correct` CLI command (`correct merge <surface> <canonical>` and
  `correct ignore <surface>`) that records manual corrections in
  `corrections.json`. `reconcile` already consumes that file, so a
  `rebuild` applies corrections deterministically — the correction
  propagates to a version-controlled data source while reconstruction stays
  fully reproducible from corpus + corrections.
- The pyvis HTML is static, so corrections are made via the CLI rather than
  in-browser. An in-GUI correction editor would need a server-backed app
  (e.g. Streamlit) — noted as a possible future enhancement.

## 2026-05-22 — Front-end / back-end web app

- Upgraded the visualization to a real client/server web app: a **FastAPI
  backend** (`server.py`) plus a **vanilla-JS + Cytoscape.js frontend**
  (`ailandscape/web/`). New `serve` CLI command runs it via uvicorn,
  bound to 127.0.0.1.
- Scale is handled by the *backend*: the full graph (6,000 nodes / 95k
  edges) never reaches the browser. The API serves focused subgraphs
  (`/api/graph`), search (`/api/search`), node neighborhoods
  (`/api/node/{id}`), type counts, and the overview. The frontend renders
  only what it receives — a few hundred nodes — so it stays smooth on a
  single laptop. No JS build toolchain (Cytoscape.js via CDN).
- In-browser features: search, type / mention / edge-weight filters,
  click-a-node detail panel with neighbors, and **in-GUI corrections** —
  "ignore" / "merge into" POST to `/api/correct`, which writes
  `corrections.json` and re-runs *reconcile only* (no NER), so the corrected
  graph is ready in seconds and reconstruction stays deterministic.
- Chose a vanilla-JS frontend over a React/SPA build for MVP speed, zero
  build step, and reproducibility. The static `visualize` command is kept
  as a shareable-snapshot export.
- Tests cover the API with FastAPI's TestClient (config paths monkeypatched
  to a temp graph). 55 tests pass.

## 2026-05-22 — Quality pass: coreference, layout, data quality, README

- **Coreference** (`reconcile`): a single-word person name that is the last
  word of exactly one multi-word person node folds into it ("Hegseth" ->
  "Pete Hegseth"); ambiguous surnames (two people, same last name) are left
  alone. Edges are re-pointed through the merge, self-loops dropped. The
  rebuild merged 133 partial-name nodes (6,000 -> 5,867 nodes).
- **Graph layout**: the web visualization now uses the fcose layout for
  cluster-respecting spread. Labels are decluttered — font size scales with
  node prominence and small labels hide when zoomed out. The default minimum
  edge weight was raised so the default view is far less dense (372 vs 635
  edges) and visibly spread, with groupings still close.
- **Data quality**: the overview gained distribution metrics (nodes by
  mention count, edges by weight) and an "isolated nodes" signal; a compact
  Overview panel was added to the web sidebar.
- **README.md** added (it was missing — a skills_plan requirement):
  high-level description, the pipeline flow, setup, and all CLI commands.
- Completed the doable TODO items. SAM.gov / SBIR data sources and typed
  semantic relationships remain in TODO — they need API keys / relation
  extraction and are larger efforts.

## 2026-05-22 — Typed semantic relationships

- Until now every edge was `co_occurs_with` (entities sharing a document).
  Added `ailandscape/relations.py`, which extracts **8 directed, typed
  relationships** from cue phrases: `leads`, `part_of`, `located_in`,
  `acquires`, `partners_with`, `awards_contract`, `develops`, `supplies`.
  This is the "is_subordinate_to / better links" TODO item — `part_of`
  covers sub-organizations, `leads` links people to the orgs they run.
- **Extraction is deliberately conservative** — precision over recall. A
  relation is emitted only when two entities sit within 55 characters, with
  no sentence boundary between them, a recognised cue phrase in the gap, and
  entity types that fit the relation (e.g. `develops` needs an organization
  subject). Wrong relationships are worse than missing ones in a knowledge
  graph, so the rules favour fewer, trustworthy edges.
- **Passive voice is handled**: "Anduril was awarded a contract by the
  Pentagon" is detected as passive and the direction flipped, yielding the
  same `(Pentagon, awards_contract, Anduril)` triple as the active form.
  Verb cues cover irregular forms (built, produced, made).
- **Integration**: `reconcile` collects relations per document, resolves
  subject/object to canonical node keys (after coreference merges), tallies
  repeats into weighted directed edges, and writes them alongside the
  co-occurrence edges. The KG schema already keyed edges by
  `(src, dst, relation)`, so a typed edge and a co-occurrence edge can
  coexist between the same pair.
- Typed edges **bypass the min-weight filter** everywhere (a single clearly
  stated relationship is meaningful; a single co-occurrence is noise) and
  are rendered distinctly — bright blue, arrowed, labelled — in both the
  web app and the static `visualize` export.
- Rebuild result: 217 typed relationships across the 378-document corpus
  (leads 83, develops 41, awards_contract 25, partners_with 24, part_of 22,
  supplies 19, located_in 2, acquires 1). 67 tests pass.

## 2026-05-22 — SBIR/STTR awards as a second data source

- Added `ailandscape/sbir.py`: the first **non-RSS data source**. The
  SBIR/STTR programs fund early-stage R&D at small firms; SBIR.gov publishes
  awarded contracts via a public JSON API (no key). Awarded contracts are a
  concrete primary source for where defense AI funding actually goes.
- The API has **no keyword search** (only agency / firm / year / research
  institution), so AI relevance is decided locally: an award is kept if its
  title, abstract, or research-area keywords match a broad AI term list
  spanning core AI/ML, model families, perception, data science, and
  embodied-AI robotics (`robotics`, `motion planning`, `imitation
  learning`, ...). Acronyms (AI, ML, LLM, NLP, SLAM) are matched
  case-sensitively as bare uppercase tokens, so they never fire on
  lowercase fragments inside ordinary words ("ai" in "maintain").
- Each AI award becomes a corpus document like any scraped article, so it
  flows through the unchanged NER / reconcile / graph pipeline. The body is
  an **active-voice lead sentence** ("&lt;agency&gt; awarded &lt;firm&gt; a
  contract", plus a partnership sentence when a research institution is
  named) followed by the project abstract — phrased so the typed-relation
  extractor reads the funding direction correctly (agency -> firm). Verified
  on the fixture: 4 awards yield agency/firm/PI/institution nodes plus
  `awards_contract` and `partners_with` edges.
- **Resilience**: the public API sits behind an AWS API gateway that
  throttles hard and returns HTTP 429 (`TooManyRequestsError`). `fetch_awards`
  backs off and retries on 429; if it still fails — or on any other status —
  `SBIRError` is raised and `scrape_sbir_into_corpus` skips SBIR for that
  run, the same soft-failure handling as a single dead RSS feed. New awards
  are capped per run so SBIR cannot dominate the corpus.
- Integration: `SBIR_QUERIES` in `feeds.py` (DOD-focused, recent years);
  `run` scrapes feeds *and* SBIR; a dedicated `sbir` CLI command pulls
  awards and rebuilds. `samples/sample_sbir.json` + `tests/test_sbir.py`
  keep it deterministically tested without the network. 89 tests pass.
- Status note: at implementation time the SBIR.gov API returned HTTP 429
  (`TooManyRequestsError`, "The SBIR Public API is not available at this
  time") for *every* request — the public endpoint appears throttled off at
  the gateway, not a 503 maintenance page. So no live awards are in the
  corpus yet; the integration degrades gracefully and will populate on the
  next `run` / `sbir` once the endpoint is reachable. Verified end-to-end
  against the fixture in the meantime.

## 2026-05-23 — Data-quality pipeline improvements (10-item batch)

A coordinated set of changes targeting observability, drift detection, and
curator-loop velocity. What landed and why:

### Observability
- **Per-feed health scorecards** in `pipeline.scrape_into_corpus` (and the
  SBIR / J-Books variants): each scrape now records `{fetched, added,
  extracted, error}` per source name. The data lands in `run_history.jsonl`
  on every full `run` and is consumed by `report._feed_health`, which
  surfaces feeds that produced no new docs in 14 days and contributed no
  adds in recent runs — "silently broken" feeds that were invisible before.
- **Quality KPIs on each run record** (`pipeline._quality_kpis_after_rebuild`):
  singletons, isolated nodes, partial-name duplicates, mentions-per-node,
  typed-relation count. These ride on `run_history.jsonl` and feed a new
  `overview --diff` view (`report.diff_runs` / `render_diff`) that shows
  run-over-run deltas with a `**` marker on changes >= 10%.
- **Date-parse coverage** (`corpus.published_date_status`): distinguishes
  `missing` from `unparseable`. The overview now lists per-source rates so
  a feed shipping a date format the pipeline can't read no longer silently
  flattens to `fetched_at`.
- **Extraction-signal coverage** (`report._signal_coverage`): docs whose
  body produced zero entities, and docs with body < 300 chars, get counted
  and surfaced — fingerprints of silent scrape failure or off-topic content.

### Curator loop
- **Gazetteer-candidate auto-surface** (`review._gazetteer_candidates`):
  high-frequency multi-word `misc` nodes (docs >= 3, mentions >= 5) not in
  the gazetteer land in `review.json` under `gazetteer_candidates`. Closes
  the loop from "find a missing entity by hand" to "review the curator
  shortlist".
- **Bulk-apply from review.json** (`ailandscape correct-from-review`): walks
  the accumulating store and prompts y/n for each partial-name merge,
  structural-noise ignore, and acronym mapping, then writes a single batched
  update to `corrections.json` and rebuilds. `--yes` skips prompts for
  trusted bulk runs.
- **Apposition-based acronym coreference** (`ailandscape/acronyms.py`): the
  long-deferred TODO. Mines `<Expansion> (<ACRONYM>)` / `<ACRONYM>
  (<Expansion>)` appositions and verifies the acronym is the initials
  sequence of the expansion — trying every include/skip combination on
  connector words ("of"/"the"/"and"), since "DOD" includes the connector
  initial while "DARPA" skips it. Greedy regex captures are refined to the
  shortest matching span. Pairs are gated by `MIN_DOC_FREQ = 2`; survivors
  land in `review.json` for human approval — never auto-merged. First live
  run on the corpus surfaced 32 corroborated mappings (EECS, CSAIL, CCA,
  ISR, IRGC, UAE, NLP, LLM, AFSOC, HELIOS, ...).

### Reconcile / NER hardening
- **Email-key person merging** (`reconcile._coreference_by_email`): two
  person nodes carrying the same `attributes.email` (extracted by
  `_split_attributes` from academic-blog contact blocks) fold into one
  node. Shared role inboxes (`info@`, `press@`, ...) are excluded.
- **NER chain hygiene** (`ner.py`): the proper-noun extractor now breaks
  the chain at a token ending in `.`/`?`/`!` (sentence terminator),
  requires continuation tokens to be 2+ characters (rejects "for X" bridges
  in math-heavy text), rejects multi-word ALL-CAPS phrases as headers
  ("BREAKING NEWS"), and adds common imperative verbs ("Use", "Call",
  "Let", ...) to `_STOPWORDS`. Reconcile also rejects entity surfaces
  containing math/code operators (`=`, `<>`, `{}`, `[]`, `/`) before
  `normalize()` strips them and the signal is lost.

### Test rigor
- **Golden-snapshot regression guard** (`tests/test_golden_snapshot.py`):
  the bundled 4-article sample feed rebuilds to a fixed 17 nodes / 44 edges
  / 37 NER entities. Any silent heuristic change that drops a real entity
  or invents new merges trips this test.
- **NER adversarial battery** (`tests/test_ner_adversarial.py`): code
  blocks, URL slugs, CSS class names, math notation, emoji runs, ALL-CAPS
  headers, mixed-language prose, URLs/emails in text, and extreme-length
  phrases all assert "no graph node survives." These caught and drove the
  NER hygiene fixes above.
- 50 new tests total; 220 pass (3 skipped — spaCy-dependent), up from a
  170-test baseline.
